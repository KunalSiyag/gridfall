# Web demo deployment (GMI AgentBox)

The web build is how people try GridFall without installing anything. `tools/export.sh web` runs
`tools/web_export.py`, which builds an isolated staging copy of the project (never the source
tree), caps the prop and character textures at 256 px, converts every WAV to Ogg, exports the
no-threads Godot 4 web build, aliases duplicate PCK payloads to one copy and publishes the result
under a content-addressed `releases/<hash>/` directory. The `.pck` that ships is ~194 MB instead of
~654 MB, and the whole site is ~224 MB. A first visit moves ~132 MB (Brotli). `deploy/web/` serves
it from Caddy, a static file server only — players' browsers call `api.gmi-serving.com` themselves
with each player's own GMI key (CORS allows it), and without a key the game runs offline (replay
cache, then heuristics). There is no server-side key by design.

## Build and ship a new image

1. `tools/export.sh web` — needs `ffmpeg` with libvorbis and the `web_nothreads_release.zip` export
   template (see the script's help for the one-time install). `EXPORT: PASS` ends the run and
   `build/web/build-report.json` records the cap/audio/dedup numbers and the release version.
   The script deletes the previous export first; the source assets and desktop imports are never
   touched.
2. `docker build -t <registry>/gridfall-web:<tag> -f deploy/web/Dockerfile .` from the repo root
   (the root `.dockerignore` keeps the context to `build/web/` and `deploy/web/`). The image
   pre-compresses the `.pck` and `.wasm` with Brotli q11 (`-w 24`) and gzip at build time, so the
   box's 2 vCPUs never compress anything per visitor; Caddy serves those sidecars with
   `file_server { precompressed br gzip }`. The build takes ~17 minutes alone on a quiet machine;
   the image is ~1.1 GB unpacked.
3. GMI AgentBox pulls the image from an OCI registry: the register form takes an **Image URL**
   only (Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR; there is no image-upload control in the console as of 2026-10).
   Scan the build before a public push — `docker history` and the image env must be clean, no
   `.env` / `*.pem` / key files in `build/web`, no token-shaped strings anywhere (the `.pck` is
   stored uncompressed, so plain `grep -a` does see its strings) — then tag and push both a
   rolling and a commit tag so a running build traces back to its code:
   `docker tag gridfall-web:latest docker.io/<user>/gridfall-web:main` (and `:<commit>`), push.
   A private registry means typing its credentials into GMI's **Requires sign-in** toggle; a
   public image built from a public repo avoids that entirely.
4. Console → Agentbox → **Register Template**: the single-page form is the **Host on GMI** tab
   (the GMI CE Deployment path; "Connect your agent" is the self-hosted + MaaS flow). Fill the
   internal project name and the image URL, keep region **IOWA IDC-1** (the only one), leave
   **Requires sign-in** off for a public image, and keep the port mapping `web`, HTTPS/2,
   external 443 -> internal 8080: Caddy listens on 8080 and `/healthz` answers the platform's
   port check. The **GMI_MAAS_API_KEY** row is auto-injected by GMI at deploy and cannot be
   turned off in this UI; the static server never reads it and players' mayors still bring
   their own key, so no env variables are added. There is no compute-tier picker here either:
   Host on GMI provisions the Container sandbox (2 vCPU, 4 GiB).
5. Launch from My Agents → the agent → **Instance**: in the dialog pick the **Container**
   compute tier radio (the form wants an explicit pick even though the default shows), add no
   model and no variables, then **Create Instance**. The instance gets a public URL
   (`https://ct-<uuid>-web.caas-us1.gmicloud.ai`). Billing is per second of active runtime
   ($0.0475/hr at the Container tier) and a provisioned instance stays up until you
   **Terminate** it — the console has no idle-stop or auto-stop setting as of 2026-10, so
   "always on" is the default for your own instance. The **Integration** tab holds the Template
   ID and the lifecycle API for scripted control: `POST /v1/agents/deployments/<slug>/tasks`
   provisions, `GET /v1/agents/tasks/<id>` polls to `running`, `DELETE` terminates — Bearer
   token from GMI account settings. Registering is private; the marketplace is a separate
   "List an agent" action.
6. Never bake a key, prompt or save into the image; nothing under `data/` is player-specific.

## Verify

- `curl https://<public-host>/healthz` returns `ok` (also the platform's port health check;
  the container maps 443 -> 8080 by default).
- `curl -sI -H 'Accept-Encoding: br' https://<public-host>/releases/<hash>/index.pck` must report
  `content-encoding: br`, `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` and a
  `content-length` around 100 MB; the same URL with `--compressed` transfers that many bytes
  instead of 186 MB. `curl -sI https://<public-host>/index.html` must say `cache-control: no-cache`.
- The page boots to the first-person city in a normal browser; the first visit moves roughly the
  compressed size of the `.pck` plus the `.wasm` and small files. Later visits come from the
  service worker cache; a new release has a new `releases/<hash>/` path and a new
  `CACHE_VERSION`, so a reload after a redeploy fetches the new build instead of the old one.
- The response headers include `cross-origin-opener-policy: same-origin` and
  `cross-origin-embedder-policy: require-corp` even though the build is no-threads (kept for a
  possible threaded variant and harmless otherwise).
- Esc -> Settings -> **GMI Cloud**: a pasted key is sent only to `api.gmi-serving.com`
  (`GMI_FAIL` console lines show rejected keys working the retry path), **Remember on this device**
  keeps it in the browser's `localStorage` (`gridfall.gmi_key`), Forget erases it.
- Save (Esc -> Save) then reload the tab: the console prints
  `GRIDFALL: continuing the saved city, day N tick M` — the save lives in the browser's IndexedDB,
  not on the container. Replacing the image never touches player saves.
- A real smoke run: `node deploy/web/smoke.js http://127.0.0.1:8080/` against a local
  `docker run -p 8080:8080 <image>` (needs Chrome; see the script header, ~10 minutes under
  software WebGL). It routes `api.gmi-serving.com` to a local mock that answers 401, so it proves
  a mayor call leaves with the player's key in the Authorization header (checked as a boolean,
  never printed) and that the game falls back, without sending anything to GMI.
- Against a live deployment use the offline mode instead:
  `GF_SMOKE_OFFLINE=1 node deploy/web/smoke.js https://<public-host>/` — no mock, nothing typed
  into the key page, nothing stored, and the run fails if a single request reaches
  `api.gmi-serving.com`: the mayors plan offline (replay cache, then heuristics), which is the
  state every visitor without a key is in.

## Symptoms and fixes

- **Black screen or "wasm" compile error:** the browser got the wrong MIME type or a truncated
  file. `curl -I https://<host>/releases/<hash>/index.wasm` must say `Content-Type:
  application/wasm`; check the gateway really forwards the whole response.
- **Stuck on the loading bar:** the `.pck` request died mid-flight; watch the browser's network
  tab for a cancelled/failed request, then the platform's instance logs. A reload usually
  resumes from the browser cache.
- **Old version after a redeploy:** the root `index.html`, the service worker and the PWA
  manifest are served `no-cache`, and every release lives under its own hashed directory, so a
  reload always picks up the new build. If a browser still shows the old one, its service worker
  was never updated: unregister it (DevTools -> Application -> Service Workers) and reload.
- **`releases/<old-hash>/...` 404 after a redeploy:** the export keeps only the current and the
  previous release directory; a tab that loaded the build before that will 404 until reloaded.
  Reload the page to pick up the new release.
- **Mayors never go live although the player pasted a key:** check the browser console for
  `GMI_FAIL` lines (bad key) and that the player's account works against `api.gmi-serving.com`
  directly. The game-side breaker trips after a few failures and falls back to offline planners;
  it recovers on its own.
- **Instance will not start:** confirm the port mapping (443 -> 8080) and `/healthz`, and that the
  image entrypoint is the stock Caddy one (`deploy/web/Dockerfile` has no custom entrypoint).
- **Textures look soft on the web build:** expected — props, characters and legacy vehicles import
  at 256 px on the web only (desktop keeps the source resolution). Posters, hoardings and billboard
  art are exempt and keep their source resolution because players read them up close. Raise the cap
  in `tools/web_export.py` (`CAP_LIMIT`) or add a tree to `UNCAPPED_TREES`/`UNCAPPED_NAMES`.

## Known limitations (web / gl_compatibility)

Both are logged on every boot of the current build and both are fixed by the round-3 render work
(quality/viewport presets); this section goes away with that release.

- **`WARNING: FSR2 3D scaling is only available when using the Forward+ renderer.`** Every quality
  preset asks for FSR2 3D scaling, which the web build cannot use (WebGL2 is Compatibility only).
  It is a warning, not a failure: the build falls back and first person runs. Under desktop
  gl_compatibility the same request is a crash risk, which is why round 3 switches Compatibility to
  bilinear scaling plus MSAA.
- **`Too many instances using shader instance variables, max 4096`.** Compatibility caps instance
  uniforms at 4096. The city lives in each player's own browser save, so it is the player's city
  growing past that limit that can fail to load (around day 2, roughly 176 roads and 35 sites),
  whatever the instance's uptime — the container is a static file server and holds no city at all.
  A fresh day-1 city boots and plays. Round 3 moves the road shader's per-mesh attributes out of
  instance variables.

## Registry-URL follow-up

The GMI register form takes an **Image URL** only, and the instance is pinned to the digest it was
created with. A new push to `:main` does not move a running instance: update the template's image
reference (or recreate the instance) to deploy a new build. Tag every push with the merge commit
(`:main` and `:<sha>`) so a running instance can be traced back to its code, and record the digest
the instance actually pulled.
